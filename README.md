## Overview
For this assignment, I used After Affects for the first time and though I found it more challenging as well as time consuming than I anticipated I am getting used to it overall. We were tasked at creating a Fitness app showing different interactions and movements. I chose to focus on the overall idea of just getting an animation going in AfterAffects then putting it back into Figma to add another interaction with a home screen etc. 
## Users
The users of this project at this moment are me, myself, and I as I work to understand how I can improve my skills with after effects as well as overall UX/UI ability. 
## Learnings
I was not prepared for how time consuming this would be at all. I went into this thinking it would take an hour but later spent hours doing something that was really sparse. My hope is that this similar to the use of AI in the first assignments I will just continue to improve get faster and have better quality assets. I did find it somewhat similar to premier which is what I was hoping so it was cool to see how they are similar and use some of those same skills, but the timing in terms of just everything is much more challenging overall.
